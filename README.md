<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure authenticity and security. Our solution focuses on:
1.  The blockchain smart contract should allow users to prove product ownership.
2.  Using NFTs, the application should allow consumers to validate the product's legitimacy. A genuine product will have an NFT associated with it, which acts as proof. As a result, this helps to combat counterfeit goods.
3.  The NFts should also serve as the product's warranty card, making the system paperless and smooth.
4.  Provide the item's purchase history, warranty term, and other details.
