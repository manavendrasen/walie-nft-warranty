<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure authenticity and security. Our solution focuses on:
1.  The blockchain smart contract should allow users to prove ownership
2.  Provide the purchasing history, warranty period, and other item information
3.  The warranty card should include the item’s serial number and upon purchase be sent to the customer’s smartphone
4.  The NFTs should be decaying in nature, in that, after a certain period their use for the redemption of warranty benefits offered by the brand/retailer will expire
5.  Bonus - GUI-based tool that doesn’t require knowledge of any Blockchain programming to use by Brands and Retailers
6.  Bonus - Usage of Soulbound NFTs
7.  Bonus - Add any engagement/gamification construct to the loyalty program
